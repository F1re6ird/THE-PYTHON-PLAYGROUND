# THE-PYTHON-PLAYGROUND 🐍

Welcome to **THE-PYTHON-PLAYGROUND** – my personal space for building, experimenting, and sharpening my Python skills through hands-on projects.

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository is a collection of mini-projects built as I grow from beginner to advanced Python developer. Each project here is an exercise in learning, problem-solving, and applying programming concepts.

The goal? **Consistency, growth, and creativity through code.**

## 🧩 Projects

### ✅ Hangman Game
The classic Hangman game in the terminal – built using core Python. Comes with ASCII art stages and a victory pose to celebrate wins!  
→ [Check it out in the `/hangman` folder](./hangman)

I’ll keep adding projects as I explore topics like:

- Algorithms & Data Structures
- File I/O
- Games (like Tic Tac Toe, Snake, etc.)
- APIs
- Automation scripts
- Terminal-based tools
- And more...
